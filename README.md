## Hi there 👋

My name is Danilo Silva (he/him). I'm a [Cloud Developer Advocate](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/advocates/lucas-santos) at @microsoft from Brazil! I'm working mostly with containers and Kubernetes along with Node.js and TypeScript! I love Open-Source and I'm a developer since 2011! I love to teach and learn! I'm a former [Microsoft MVP](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/5003259) and an active [Google Developer Expert](https://developers.google.com/community/experts/directory/profile/profile-lucas_santos).

- 📖  I also [wrote a book](https://tudosobrekubernetes.tech/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=profile_readme&utm_campaign=fixed_link) about Kubernetes! It's in Portuguese but there are plans for new versions in other languages! Share to your friends if you like it 🤓

I'm also an avid contributor to open source and love to create and develop new projects and ideas! If you want to work with me just drop me a line in any of my social networks below!
